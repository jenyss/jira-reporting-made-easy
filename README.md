# Jira Reporting Made Easy

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Powered by Google ADK &amp; Atlassian MCP</em></p>

**This agent analyzes JIRA ticket cycle times and state workflow transitions through interactive visualizations.** It processes individual ticket changelogs to extract state transitions with timestamps, then generates Sankey diagrams, histograms, and bar charts to reveal workflow patterns and bottlenecks. 

The agent works with any JIRA instance and is perfect for product managers, engineering leads, and process improvement teams who need data-driven insights into their development workflows.

### Key Features

* Sankey Flow Diagrams - Visual workflow paths showing ticket movement between states
* State Time Histograms - Distribution analysis for cycle time spent in specific states
* Comparative Bar Charts - Total time analysis across all workflow states
* Bottleneck Detection - Automated identification of slow-moving tickets and process inefficiencies
* Data Validation - Built-in checks for impossible transitions and date inconsistencies
